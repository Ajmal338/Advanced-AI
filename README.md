# Advanced-AI
This is an introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks using TensorFlow 2.x Keras API. The dataset that we will work with is the Cifar10 dataset, a dataset of images from 10 different classes, and we will use two Sequential CNN with different architectures to identify the class of an image, and compare between the models.
